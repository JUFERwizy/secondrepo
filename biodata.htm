         <p><h4 id="content">I'm Andrew Couldwell. I'm a designer who codes. I'm also the author of Laying the Foundations (a book about design systems, web design, and product design). Iâ€™ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build.</h4></p>
